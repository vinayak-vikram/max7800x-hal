This is an [Embedded HAL] (Hardware Abstraction Layer) for the MAX78000 and MAX78002 microcontrollers from Analog Devices.

The HAL is built on top of a Peripheral Access Crate, which provides low-level access to the microcontroller's registers. The HAL provides a higher-level interface to the peripherals, making it easier to write applications.

[Embedded HAL]: https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal

[`max78002-pac`]: https://github.com/vinayak-vikram/max78002-pac

## Target selection
Exactly one target feature must be enabled. `max78000` is the default and pulls in [`max78000-pac`]; `max78002` pulls in [`max78002-pac`] instead.

```toml
max7800x-hal = { version = "0.7.1", default-features = false, features = ["max78002", "rand", "rt"] }
```

The target feature selects the PAC re-exported as `hal::pac` along with the
chip-specific constants: IPO frequency (100 MHz vs 120 MHz), flash size and
page size (512 KiB / 8 KiB vs 2.5 MiB / 16 KiB), and the pins available on
each GPIO port.

> [!NOTE]  
> This HAL is under active development. As a result, the API is volatile and subject to change. Be sure to refer to the [changelog] for breaking changes.

## Getting Started
If you already have an existing Rust project, you can add this crate by running:
```sh
cargo add max7800x-hal
```

Otherwise, we recommend getting started using this [Crate template for the MAX78000FTHR board](https://github.com/sigpwny/max78000fthr-template). If you are not using the MAX78000FTHR board, you can still use the template as a reference for setting up your own project.

```sh
cargo generate --git https://github.com/sigpwny/max78000fthr-template
```

## Documentation
Documentation for this HAL can be built by running:
```sh
cargo doc --open
```

Documentation can also be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/max7800x-hal).
